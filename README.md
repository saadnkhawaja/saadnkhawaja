Hi there, I'm Saad Khawaja! 👋
I'm a passionate developer who loves blending creativity with technology. Over the years, I have explored a diverse range of technology stacks, gaining a solid background in game development (Unity, ThreeJS, PlayCanvas), app development (Electron, React Native), web development (LAMP, MEAN), and UI/UX design. 
I LOVE creating developer tools and utilities that enhance productivity and help automate those 🛠️💤 tedious, reptitive tasks. I've had over 🏆 100,000 downloads on my assets on the Unity Asset Store.

🎮 Game Development: Crafting immersive and engaging games
📱 App Development: Building robust mobile and desktop applications.
💻 Web Development: Developing dynamic and responsive websites.
🎨 UI/UX Design: Designing user-centric interfaces.
🏗️ Systems Architecture: Architecting scalable and efficient systems.

🌱 Currently Learning
I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. Currently, I'm diving deeper into:

- Unreal Engine & GoDot
- Machine Learning and AI

When I'm not coding, I'm probably:
🎧 listening or playing music
🎮 gaming (aoe2 for sure)
👨‍👩‍👧 doing father and husband duties
🏓 playing sports
☕ enjoying a good cup of chai or coffee
