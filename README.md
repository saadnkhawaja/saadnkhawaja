# Hi there, I'm Saad Khawaja! 👋

I'm a passionate developer who loves blending creativity with technology. Over the years, I have explored a diverse range of technology stacks, gaining a solid background in game development (Unity, ThreeJS, PlayCanvas), app development (Electron, React Native), web development (LAMP, MEAN), and UI/UX design.

I **LOVE** creating developer tools and utilities that enhance productivity and help automate those 🛠️💤 tedious, repetitive tasks. My assets on the Unity Asset Store have been downloaded over 🏆 100,000 times.

- 🎮 **Game Development**: Crafting immersive and engaging games.
- 📱 **App Development**: Building robust mobile and desktop applications.
- 💻 **Web Development**: Developing dynamic and responsive websites.
- 🎨 **UI/UX Design**: Designing user-centric interfaces.
- 🏗️ **Systems Architecture**: Architecting scalable and efficient systems.

I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. Currently, I'm diving deeper into:

- Unreal Engine & GoDot
- Machine Learning and AI

When I'm not coding, I'm probably:

- 🎧 Listening to or playing music
- 🎮 Gaming (AOE2 for sure)
- 👨‍👩‍👧 Doing father and husband duties
- 🏓 Playing sports
- ☕ Enjoying a good cup of chai or coffee
